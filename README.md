This repository demonstrates an example of inefficient list concatenation in Haskell using the `++` operator. The `bug.hs` file contains the inefficient code, while `bugSolution.hs` offers an improved approach using the `Data.Sequence` library, providing O(1) concatenation at the end and O(log n) for insertion at the head.  The difference in performance becomes significant with larger lists.  This example highlights the importance of understanding time complexity when dealing with list manipulations in Haskell.
